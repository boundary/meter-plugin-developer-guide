Other Meter Plugin Examples
===========================


## Example Meter Plugin

To get started we are going to walk through the contents of an existing plugin and deploy a meter plugin into a Boundary account. This will short cut the number of development tasks outlined earlier so you can gain some initial experience when developing your custom meter plugin. The example meter plugin [boundary-plugin-ticker](https://github.com/boundary/boundary-plugin-ticker) collects stock price and volume from the user configured [ticker symbol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_symbol).

The steps to run the meter

1. Make a copy of an existing plugin repository which contains a complete plugin
2. Stage the plugin into a Boundary account
3. Add the plugin into a Boundary account.
4. Add the plugin to a meter
5. View metric values on Dashboard

Before proceeding with the steps outlined above the following prerequisites must be satisfied:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Command line installation of Git, [download]()
2. Administrative login for a Boundary account. You can create a free account [here]()
3. A meter deployed on a Linux system.
