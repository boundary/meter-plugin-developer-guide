Common Issues
=============

Here are common problems that occurr when troubleshooting plugins.

### Advanced Meters Required For Plugins

If an account is _free_ (all _trial_ accounts become free after the 14 day expires) or the account only has a _standard_ meter subscription then measurements from plugins will not display on dashboards. The exception being during the 14 day trial. A description of the differences of the __Free__, __Standard__, and __Advanced__ subscriptions are found on the [pricing page](http://www.bmc.com/truesightpulse/pricing).

### Number of Streams Exceeded

During trials accounts are limited to 100 _streams, where a stream is defined by a metric/source combination that is sending data by any means (Meter, Plugin, API).
